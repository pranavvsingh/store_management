Hide Prices 1.2       09/05/2008

Feel free to use or modify it however you wish.

This contribution works on OSCommerce v2.2 RC2a

The zip archive contains the following files:
    * stylesheet.css
    * includes/boxes/shopping_cart.php
    * shopping_cart.php
    * product_info.php
    * includes/boxes/specials.php
    * includes/boxes/whats_new.php
    * includes/modules/new_products.php
    * includes/modules/product_listing.php
    * checkout_confirmation.php
    * products_new.php
    * product_reviews.php
    * products_reviews_info.php
    * product_reviews_write.php
    * hidePrices.html

After you unzip the archive these files can be copied over your existing files as long as you have made no other changes to the code in your existing files. The best plan is to save your existing files with a .old extension so you have something to fall back on.

If you prefer you can edit your existing files in place and view your saved changes incrementally. At the moment you can refer to the hidePrices.html instructions to do an edit of your existing files, however this file references an older version of OSCommerce. Mostly it is just the line numbers that have changed, but the two files inside the /modules subdirectory are not referenced.

I will update the html file at my first opportunity, until then struggle along as best you can, or email me for help.
